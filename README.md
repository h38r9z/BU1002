In   response to   previous student feedback and other data,   the   following   enhancements   to   this   subject   have   been   made:
•    While the   pedagogy   behind weekly online quizzes and feedback   assists   student   learning,   it   led   to   increased
assessment   burden on students. Assessment Task   1   has   been changed to one   online   quiz to   provide feedback   to students   prior to census   date.
•    Students   requested additional   resources to assist with   assessment 2.   Additional   resources   have   been   provided   and are accessed from Assessment folder 2.
